00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:07.140
10 Celebrities You Didn’t Realize Were In
Star Trek

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:50.390
10.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.820
Jim O’Heir

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.750
Much loved for his portrayal of bumbling civil
servant Jerry Gergich in the NBC comedy Parks

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.150
and Recreation, veteran character actor Jim
O’Heir is also a member of the enormous

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.310
Star Trek family.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.689
O’Heir (whose Parks co-star Chris Pratt
auditioned for the role of Kirk in the re-launched

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.780
Star Trek movie series) donned a plastic forehead
to become a member of the Jye, a humanoid

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.909
species of the Delta Quadrant in the Star
Trek: Voyager episode Critical Care.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.219
Though unnamed, O’Heir’s character had
an interesting story arc within the episode.

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:24.729
His character was betrayed by the episode’s
antagonist Gar (who had an affair with his

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:25.729
wife).

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.670
Though O’Heir’s appearance was little
more than background dressing, for fans of

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.149
Parks and Recreation, his brief and unheralded
appearance is sure to make them smile.

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:35.149
9.

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:36.459
Seth MacFarlane

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:40.829
The man behind Family Guy and Ted is famous
for his love of Star Wars, which has seeped

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.060
over into his hit animated show on numerous
occasions.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.889
However, Seth MacFarlane is also a huge fan
of the Star Trek franchise as evidenced by

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:52.149
his appearance in two episodes of Star Trek:
Enterprise.

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.200
In seasons three and four of Enterprise MacFarlane
appeared as Rivers, a Starfleet engineer.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.709
Rivers remained in the background, but MacFarlane’s
presence was felt elsewhere in the series.

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:05.619
The Enterprise character Ensign MacFarlane,
who appeared in the episode The Xindi, was

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.479
named for the famous cartoonist.

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.660
Keen fans of Family Guy would also note that
MacFarlane reveals his fandom for Star Trek

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.540
with a multitude of scenes parodying the original
series, as well as The Next Generation.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.160
After all, the fact that Patrick Stewart has
been so prominently featured in McFarlane’s

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.280
work isn’t just due to the fact that Stewart
is awesome; it’s because MacFarlane is an

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.680
enormous fanboy.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.590
Who says you can only love Star Wars or Star
Trek?

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.590
8.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.590
Bryan Singer

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.730
Few directors have influenced modern science
fiction more than Bryan Singer.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.450
The director of X-men, X2, X-Men: Days of
Future Past, and Superman Returns is a well

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.340
known super-fan of Star Trek.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.200
Seeking to mix business with pleasure, Singer
has been trying to bring a new incarnation

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.320
of Star Trek back to television.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.780
As famous fans of the series often are, Singer
was offered the chance to appear in the franchise.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.570
In the 2002 movie Star Trek Nemesis Singer
appeared as a tactical officer aboard the

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.210
USS Enterprise-E, commanded by Captain Jean
Luc Picard (played by Patrick Stewart, who

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.100
– as Dr. Charles Xavier – Singer has directed
on multiple occasions within the wildly successful

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.550
X-Men franchise).

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.550
7.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.140
Joan Collins

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.700
Iconic diva Joan Collins achieved critical
acclaim for her work in film, theatre, television,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.700
and literature.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.610
However, the Dynasty star is also remembered
for making guest appearances in the biggest

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.990
TV shows of the 60s and 70s, including Batman,
Mission: Impossible, and Star Trek: The Original

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.990
Series.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.620
On April 6, 1967 The City on the Edge of Forever
aired for the first time, it was the 28th

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.319
episode of Star Trek to ever be shown on television.

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:41.560
The episode focuses on Dr. McCoy, who is transported
back into the 1930s forcing his crew members

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.490
into a delicate rescue mission.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.680
In 1930s New York McCoy meets Edith Keeler,
a social worker running a soup-kitchen, played

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.430
by the legendary Collins.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.510
The episode is remembered as one of, if not
the, best episodes in the original series.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.620
For her contribution to an episode which lives
on as a favourite to many, Collins’ cameo

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.980
must certainly be considered one of the greatest
ever in the franchise.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.010
6.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.400
Tom Morello

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.110
Founding member of Grammy Award-Winning band
Rage Against The Machine, Tom Morello is frequently

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.780
listed as one of the most influential guitarists
to ever pick up the instrument.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.379
It would be surprising to many, including
legions of “Rage” fans, that Morello appeared

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:21.590
twice within the Star Trek franchise.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.289
In 1998 Morello appeared in the feature film
Star Trek: Insurrection.

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:30.080
He played a Son’a officer, the Son’a being
the antagonists to the crew of the Enterprise.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.830
In 2000 Morello appeared as a Starfleet crewmember
in season six of Star Trek: Voyager, in the

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.389
episode Good Shepherd.

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.330
The episode featured Captain Janeway taking
a hands-on approach with the tutelage of a

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.599
trio of underperforming crew members.

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.180
Though Morello’s performances may have been
missed by most, he did manage to get a line

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.580
in on Voyager, instructing the enigmatic Captain
Janeway that her desired destination was,

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.490
“to the left, ma’am”.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.490
5.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.250
King Abdullah bin Al-Hussein

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.150
For many reasons, it’s good to be the king.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.639
King of Jordan, Abdullah II bin al-Hussein,
who is a huge fan of Star Trek, was thrilled

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.779
to be offered the chance to tour the set of
Star Trek: Voyager in 1996.

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:11.199
Much to the Royal’s surprise, he was offered
the chance to appear in the background of

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.300
the show, which he accepted immediately.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.379
King Abdullah played a science officer in
the opening of the season two episode Investigations.

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:21.570
Many would think pretending to be a member
of a Starfleet would be a stretch for the

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.570
monarch.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.319
However, King Abdullah is more than familiar
with military matters.

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:29.699
The King is a graduate of the British Royal
Military Academy who served as a Second Lieutenant

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:31.220
in the Royal Hussars.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.349
In Jordan, he served as a member of the 40th
Armored Brigade and the Royal Jordanian Air

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:38.150
Force as a cobra attack helicopter pilot.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.150
4.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.430
Mick Fleetwood

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.629
Mick Fleetwood, of Fleetwood Mac fame, had
perhaps the strangest cameo ever witnessed

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:46.110
in the Star Trek universe.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.580
Manhunt, from season two of Star Trek: The
Next Generation, featured ship counselor Deanna

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:56.449
Troi’s mother Lwaxana (played by Gene Rodenberry’s
then-wife), searching for a mate on the Starship

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:57.449
Enterprise.

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:02.300
Among the pool of unsuspecting bachelors is
a highly uncomfortable Captain Picard.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.560
During the episode, Fleetwood appears briefly
as an Antedean dignitary.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.949
However, despite Fleetwood getting a close-up,
even his most dedicated fans would have missed

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:11.839
him entirely were they not clued in.

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:17.529
Fleetwood, an enormous fan of Star Trek himself,
was given a costume that included a huge fish-like

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:20.879
headpiece that rendered him completely unrecognizable.

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:26.499
The hilarious wardrobe and unique cameo added
to what lives on as one of TNG’s most lighthearted

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:28.379
and charming episodes.

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:29.379
3.

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:30.379
Stephen Hawking

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:34.490
Stephen Hawking, owner of one of the most
brilliant minds in recorded history, has influenced

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.909
the Star Trek franchise in a myriad of ways.

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:41.310
The scientist’s research into space, and
particularly black holes, has provided ample

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.749
fodder for the writers of Star Trek and many
other sci-fi series and movies.

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:47.759
Hawking has many achievements to be proud
of.

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:51.719
One of the least important accomplishments
of Hawking, which is still pretty cool, is

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:55.729
that he is the only person to play himself
in the Star Trek franchise.

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:59.569
In the sixth season of Star Trek: The Next
Generation, Hawking appeared in the episode

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:00.569
Descent.

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:04.460
In the episode chief science officer Data
sought scientific advice from the holographs

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.819
of Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, and Stephen
Hawking – over a game of poker.

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:12.559
Hawking was also honored in the franchise
by having a shuttlecraft named after him,

00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:16.979
which appeared in The Next Generation series
as well as the movie Star Trek Generations.

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:18.059
2.

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:19.289
Iggy Pop

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:24.039
Unlike most celebrity cameos, when punk rock
icon Iggy Pop appeared in the Star Trek: Deep

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:28.529
Space Nine episode The Magnificent Ferengi,
he wasn’t relegated to the background or

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:31.319
protected from challenging scenes and dialogue.

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:35.839
Iggy – a sci-fi nut at heart – played
Yelgrun, a Vorta clone, whose role within

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:40.119
the evil Dominion was to coax and convince
other races into servitude.

00:07:40.119 --> 00:07:44.619
Iggy’s Yelgren featured in an entertaining
game of cat-and-mouse with everyone’s favourite

00:07:44.619 --> 00:07:45.619
Ferengi: Quark.

00:07:45.619 --> 00:07:50.569
Yelgrun and Quark faced off in negotiations
over a prisoner exchange (with one prisoner

00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:52.559
being Quark’s mother Ishka).

00:07:52.559 --> 00:07:56.589
Quark would eventually best Yelgrun, with
Iggy’s character ending up in Starfleet

00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:57.589
custody.

00:07:57.589 --> 00:08:02.059
Iggy’s turn on DS9 can be considered one
of the greatest ever cameos on Star Trek thanks

00:08:02.059 --> 00:08:06.279
to the importance placed on his character,
as well as the acting chops the singer brought

00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:08.149
to the table.

00:08:08.149 --> 00:08:09.149
1.

00:08:09.149 --> 00:08:10.649
Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson

00:08:10.649 --> 00:08:14.289
Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson is well-known
for being a movie mega star, professional

00:08:14.289 --> 00:08:18.110
wrestling icon, and owner of an Instagram
account you need to follow.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:22.719
However, most people have no idea that Johnson
is also an alum of the Star Trek universe.

00:08:22.719 --> 00:08:27.280
“The People’s Champion” surprised both
Star Trek and wrestling fans in 2000 when

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.909
he appeared in Tsunkatse, an episode from
season six of Star Trek: Voyager.

00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:36.140
In the episode Johnson played to his strengths,
portraying a pit-fighting champion from the

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.140
planet Pendari.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:43.140
Johnson’s Pendari character battled popular
crew member Seven of Nine (a reformed Borg)

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.280
during the Tsunkatse fighting tournament.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.720
After an epic duel, Johnson’s Pendari was
victorious, thanks to some signature pro-wrestling

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.720
moves.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.100
Johnson’s guest appearance remains one of
the most special cameos to occur in the franchise,

00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:40.550
given the incredible success Johnson has achieved
since his stint in the delta quadrant.
